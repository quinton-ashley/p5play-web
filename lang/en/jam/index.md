["Rat Race"](https://doityourseph2.github.io/rat-race/), by Joseph Chee, prompts players to assist collared shirt and tie clad rats keen on climbing the corporate ladder. It was originally presented as an [interactive art installation](https://doityourseph.com/#/projects/rat-race) at Nanyang Technological University.

Players watch as the rats inevitably get kicked around by sloth managers, pushed by worker bees, yapped to by sneaky weasels, bombarded with the prideful peacock's trophies, and growled at by wolves in sheep's clothes. Even the lions at the top are struggling in the perpetual pursuit of money, power, and status. No one wins in a rat race!

This game won the jam because of its brilliant visuals, thought provoking theme, and charming character design. The code features excellent use of animation sequencing.

["Shenaniguns"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3171380/Shenaniguns/), by Lachlan Noble (age 15), is an online multiplayer top-down shooter. Each life you get some random things to fight with... or die trying! You could get a normal gun, but are just as likely to get bowling balls, ninja stars, or even a DJ deck?!

There's also a wide variety of maps and game modes to try out. Go head to head in a free for all, capture the flag, or team up with friends for a boss fight with Vectah.

This game won because of its zany, fast paced, and chaotic gameplay. The game's code makes great use of raycasting for hit detection and has impressive bot AI. Yet most notably, it's the first game to ever use p5play server side for online multiplayer!

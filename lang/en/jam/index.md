## ðŸ¥‡ Summer 2024 : [@coding398](https://coding398.dev/)

["Shenaniguns"](https://shenanimerica.coding398.dev/), by Lachlan Noble (age 15), is an online multiplayer top-down shooter. Each life you get some random things to fight with... or die trying! You could get a normal gun, but are just as likely to get bowling balls, ninja stars, or even a DJ deck?!

There's also a wide variety of maps and game modes to try out. Go head to head in a free for all, capture the flag, or team up with friends for a boss fight with Vectah.

This game won because of its zany, fast paced, and chaotic gameplay. The game's code makes great use of raycasting for hit detection and has impressive bot AI. Yet most notably, it's the first game to ever use p5play server side for online multiplayer!

“I was looking at the new p5play (v3) yesterday and realized it had been so long since I tried it! I didn't realize it had physics built into it. I would LOVE to make some videos with it. This is such wonderful work, thank you for supporting the community in this way!”

# r10

“I have found the p5play library to be an invaluable resource for introducing students to game design and development. Our team chose to use this library for our Game Design Summer Program due to its many customizable features, well documented resources, and easy-to-use API which make it accessible for students of all ages and skill levels.

Due to the many methods and properties included in this library, students are able to quickly bring their game visions to life with code. These games range from basic catcher games to games with multiple levels and challenging features.

In addition to the library's well-documented resources, p5play offers a wealth of support and inspiration for the students and teachers in their community. This includes their interactive learn pages that allow students to tinker with different properties and methods in the library, their tri-annual Game Jam event, and their Discord channel filled with many great resources and opportunities to find support.

Our Girls Who Code team highly recommends this library to anyone interested in game development. We can't wait to see all of the games our students create this summer with this incredible library!”

# r20

“I recently got a chance to work with Quinton and do a deep dive into the p5play library. Video game design is such a
great entrypoint for engaging students in programming projects, while introducing them to the structure of object
oriented programming in p5. I can't wait to see what my students create with this!”

# r30

“I absolutely love what you've done with the Learn pages, what a cool reference for important sprite properties, looking forward to seeing more of that. Digging through the source a bit I'd say [p5play v3] retains a ton of the appeal of earlier versions and I was able to orient pretty quick.”

# r40

“I added a unit centered on p5play to my Artistic Coding and Game Design curriculum as a way to tease object oriented programming. Students quickly adapted to sprites and groups and were beyond excited about all the interactivity built into p5play. Through games, students were able to solidify their understanding of properties and methods without even realizing they were learning some of the core concepts of object oriented programming.

My students spent time making games using the p5play library and were immensely proud of their accomplishments. Since we have used p5play, my students are now better able to understand classes and have even written some of their own!”

# r50

“I've been using variations of p5play for several years in my middle school CS class. While it was serviceable before, it was nothing like what you've done with version 3. I LOVE it! Even my younger students can be successful and learn basic coding concepts because they don't really need to know all the math and physics behind the code now. Plus everything is consistent and streamlined so new ideas make sense. Then there's your amazing new website with so many easy to understand examples. I can send my advanced students directly to the p5play website and they can just explore and build anything they want. Thank you so much for all your work!”

# r60

“p5play has been a great addition to our curriculum. It has allowed us to explore a more creative outlet for learning object orientated programming and has been invaluable in their students projects for their exams.

Since introducing p5 and p5play we have seen an uptake of over 100% for students and are now seeing huge benefits to students learning. I would highly recommend introducing p5 & p5play into your curriculum. We have now developed a bespoke series of video tutorials to allow more schools and colleges in the UK to introduce p5play to their curriculum.”

# r70

“Thank you so much for all the work Quinton. With this proper physics integration, I may start using p5play again in my classes!”

# r80

“Overall, I can't recommend p5play enough. It has provided an incredibly easy way to take my game development skills to the next level without having to learn some complicated game development software. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, I think you'll find that p5play is a valuable tool to have in your arsenal.”

# r90

“Using the library p5play in JavaScript in order to make graphical programs is a lot better then learning Python, because you get to see your program code influence something on screen.” - Student at Wyke

# r100

“Learning p5play has really helped me get more interested in coding, as it makes creating games very easy. It makes the process less time consuming and more fun!” - Student at Wyke

# r110

“I've used Tkinter in Python, which was useful to make basic applications. However, now using p5play we can make far more advanced games that are interesting and practical.” - Student at Wyke

## Why do Computer Science educators love p5play?! 😍

p5play makes Object Oriented Programming tangible. Changing the properties of game objects called [sprites](../learn/sprite.html) produces immediate visual feedback.

p5play is a natural addition to [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) based curriculum, which is already popular in schools.

Also, since it doesn't require a bespoke game editor, students gain transferrable, text based coding skills.

See the [Teach](teach) page for more information.

## Why should students learn p5play? 🤔

Every EdTech company claims their "easy and fun to use" software empowers students to "realize their creative potential", but often it's just marketing fluff.

If these platforms are so fun and creatively empowering, why are students only using them to complete assignments?

p5play makes the art of game design more accessible, without being reductive. We believe in rewarding students for learning the basics by enabling them to go beyond.

Check out the incredible games that students have [made with p5play](../play)!

## What about Scratch? 🐯

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is great for students ages 8-11, but older students have higher expectations that Scratch can't meet.

Scratch has no built-in physics engine. That means even something like a ball rolling down a slope, requires a lot of math and is incredibly tedious to implement in Scratch's block based environment.

Many of the featured games on the Scratch website were evidently made by adults. That can give students false hope that they can make something similar.

With p5play, students don't have to write their own boilerplate code for basic functionality. They can focus on the fun parts of game design!

# 17-3

## Why was p5play created? 🎨

p5play was created to definitively bridge the gap between Scratch and more complex game engines like Unity.

In p5play, sprites can have [physics colliders](../learn/sprite.html?page=1) and display [animations](../learn/animation.html). Multiple [input devices](../learn/input_devices.html) are supported, including keyboard, mouse, game controllers, and touch screens. [Groups](../learn/Group.html) enable novice programmers to harness the power of class inheritance.

**"Only the best is good enough"**  
Ole Kirk Christiansen, founder of LEGO

I don't believe in skimping on quality to make something "just for kids". p5play isn't merely a stepping stone, its elegant API makes it a joy to use for all.

Whether you're a beginner, hobbyist, or professional developer: p5play was created for you!

# 17-4

## Special Thanks 🙌

I want to start by thanking my parents for their support and for enrolling me in coding classes when I was a kid! I also want to thank my wife, Victoria, and daughter, Luna, for their support and encouragement. 💞

In addition, I appreciate the Colombian government 🇨🇴 of Gustavo Petro for giving extended visas to digital nomads. If I still lived in US, p5play probably wouldn't exist. I couldn't afford to spend countless hours on a passion project like this one.

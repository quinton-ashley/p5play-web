## Free Use Limitations

Free use under the [AGPL](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/blob/main/LICENSE.md) is limited: any works which incorporate p5play must be made publicly open source.

Typical use by schools and commercial game developers requires a proprietary license. See the [Teach](../teach) or [Pro](../pro) pages for more information.

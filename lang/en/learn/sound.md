## Sound

Use the `loadSound` function to create a `Sound` object.

Often to properly mix sounds, you'll want to use the `setVolume` function, that accepts a value in a range from 0 to 1.

For more extensive audio mixing capabilities, you can use the [p5.sound](https://p5js.org/reference/libraries/p5.sound) library.

						<p>‚ÄúI have found the p5play library to be an invaluable resource for introducing students to
							game design and development. Our team chose to use this library for our Game Design Summer
							Program due to its many customizable features, well documented resources, and easy-to-use
							API which make it accessible for students of all ages and skill levels.</p>
						<p>Due to the many methods and properties included in this library, students are able to quickly
							bring their game visions to life with code. These games range from basic catcher games to
							games with multiple levels and challenging features.</p>
						<p>In addition to the library's well-documented resources, p5play offers a wealth of support and
							inspiration for the students and teachers in their community. This includes their
							interactive learn pages that allow students to tinker with different properties and methods
							in the library, their tri-annual Game Jam event, and their Discord channel filled with many
							great resources and opportunities to find support.</p>
						<p>Our Girls Who Code team highly recommends this library to anyone interested in game
							development. We can't wait to see all of the games our students create this summer with this
							incredible library!‚Äù</p>

						p5play?! üòç</h2>
					<p>p5play makes Object Oriented Programming tangible. Changing the properties of game objects called
						<a href="../learn/sprite.html" target="_blank">sprites</a> produces immediate visual feedback.
					</p>
					<p>p5play is a natural addition to <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a> based
						curriculum, which is already popular in schools.</p>
					<p>Also, since it doesn't require a bespoke game editor, students gain transferrable, text based
						coding skills.</p>
					<p>See the <a href="teach" target="_blank">Teach</a> page for more information.</p>

					<h2 id="why-should-students-learn-p5play-ü§î">Why should students learn p5play? ü§î</h2>
					<p>Every EdTech company claims their "easy and fun to use" software empowers students to "realize
						their creative potential", but often it's just marketing fluff.</p>
					<p>If these platforms are so fun and creatively empowering, why are students only using them to
						complete assignments?</p>
					<p>p5play makes the art of game design more accessible, without being reductive. We believe in
						rewarding students for learning the basics by enabling them to go beyond.</p>
					<p>Check out the incredible games that students have <a href="../play" target="_blank">made with
							p5play</a>!</p>

					<h2 id="what-about-scratch-üêØ">What about Scratch? üêØ</h2>
					<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a> is great for students ages 8-11,
						but older students have higher expectations that Scratch can't meet.</p>
					<p>Scratch has no built-in physics engine. That means even something like a ball rolling down a
						slope, requires a lot of math and is incredibly tedious to implement in Scratch's block based
						environment.</p>
					<p>Many of the featured games on the Scratch website were evidently made by adults. That can give
						students false hope that they can make something similar.</p>
					<p>With p5play, students don't have to write their own boilerplate code for basic functionality.
						They can focus on the fun parts of game design!</p>

					<h2 id="why-was-p5play-created-üé®">Why was p5play created? üé®</h2>
					<p>Virtual worlds and game systems are powerful tools for artistic expression. Corporations
						shouldn't have a monopoly on the art of game development!</p>
					<p>p5play was created so that young game developers could create freely, without corporate
						restrictions.</p>
					<p><strong>"Only the best is good enough"</strong> - Godtfred Kirk Christiansen, founder of LEGO</p>
					<p>p5play definitively bridges the gap between Scratch and professional game engines like Unity.</p>

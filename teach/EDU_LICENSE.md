Contact <info@p5play.org> to request a custom invoice to use p5play in an educational setting.

## 1. License Grant

The Licensee is granted the right to use the [p5play.org Learn pages](https://p5play.org/learn) for educational purposes in class or coursework and in educational settings, including but not limited to schools, home schools, universities, coding bootcamps, and online tutoring.

This Agreement also covers the p5play and p5play-pro software libraries ("Content") and any proprietary supplemental materials ("Supplemental Materials") provided privately to Licensees only.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-perpetual worldwide license to use the Content and Supplemental Materials in closed-source commercial projects, subject to the following restrictions:

1. No Closed Source Modifications: The Licensee is expressly forbidden from creating a closed source fork of the Content or using modified versions of the Content in closed source projects.

2. Limited Redistribution: The Licensee is only allowed to redistribute the Supplemental Materials to their staff and students. The Licensee can not sublicense or sell the Content or Supplemental Materials to anyone. The Licensee is expressly forbidden from redistributing the Supplemental Materials in any way that would allow the general public to access them.

3. No Military Use: The Licensee is expressly forbidden from using the Content in projects that are directly sponsored by military organizations or military contractors.

Licensees retain the option to use the p5play and p5play-pro libraries under the terms of the AGPLv3.

## 2. Licensee Eligibility

Licensing fees are based on the scale of the Licensee's use of the Content at a per student rate. The Licensee must pay the appropriate amount for the number of students that will be using the Content.

Individuals over the age of 18 can pay licensing fees for their own individual use. Parental guardians or other adults can make purchases on behalf of a user that's a minor, and are responsible for ensuring compliance with this Agreement.

If Licensees have any concerns about what amount is appropriate for their use, they must contact the Licensor at info@p5play.org and explain their planned use of the Content.

Renewal of this Agreement can only be achieved through payments on a monthly or yearly basis, depending on the payment plan chosen by the Licensee.

A Licensee can pay more than the appropriate amount if they wish to support the Licensor's work to a greater extent.

Note that the Licensor reserves the right to change the cost of renewing this license agreement at any time, but will give at least a one month notice to Licensees before doing so.

## 3. Attribution Required

The Licensee must publicly display appropriate credit to the Licensor for the Content, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the Licensee or the Licensee's use, unless the Licensor has given prior written consent.

Attribution can be accomplished by maintaining the "made with p5play" Loading Screen, which is enabled by default, or in any reasonable manner.

## 4. No Warranty

The Content is provided "as is." The Licensor makes no warranties, express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, concerning the Content.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

If Licensee has any issues with the Content, they must contact the Licensor at info@p5play.org. The Licensor will make a reasonable effort to resolve the issue in a timely manner.

If the Licensee is not satisfied with the Content, it is their responsibility to discontinue use of the Content and terminate their renewal of this Agreement.

The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages suffered by the Licensee resulting from the use or inability to use the Content.

## 6. Termination

Termination of the Agreement will occur if the Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Therefore, termination can occur automatically, without notice from the Licensor.

Any lapse in licensing payments will result in the immediate termination of this Agreement.

## 7. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement can be amended by the Licensor at any time. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

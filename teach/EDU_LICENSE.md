**_For commercial use, see the [p5play Professional License](https://p5play.org/pro)._**

## 1. License Grant

This Agreement ("License") governs the use of the p5play and p5play-pro software libraries (collectively, the "Content").

The Licensee is granted the right to use the [p5play.org Learn pages](https://p5play.org/learn) for instructional purposes in class or coursework and in educational settings, including but not limited to schools, home schools, universities, coding bootcamps, and online tutoring.

Supplemental Materials, such as the p5play-ios app template and p5play Game Design Fundamentals curriculum, are provided exclusively to authorized Licensees. These materials are intended to enhance the Licensees use of the Content and are not to be redistributed or used outside the scope of this Agreement.

The rights granted by this license extend to all students for whom the Licensee has paid the appropriate per-student fees. After the licensing term expires, students may continue to use p5play under the terms of the p5play Personal License or the [p5play Professional License](https://p5play.org/pro).

The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-perpetual worldwide license to use the Content, subject to the following restrictions.

### 1a. Limited Commercial Use

The Licensee may use the Content for educational business purposes, including:

- Paid courses or tutorials
- Educational platforms and learning management systems
- For-profit educational institutions
- Private tutoring services

The Licensee may not use the Content for commercial purposes that are not directly related to education, such as:

- Game development for profit
- Commercial software development
- Commercial web development
- Commercial art or design
- Marketing or advertising not related to the Licensee's educational services

The Licensee must create an account on p5play.org and agree to the [p5play Professional License](https://p5play.org/pro) to use the Content for commercial purposes not related to education.

### 1b. Derivative Work

Publishing modified versions of the Content ("Derivative Work") is permitted only for the purpose of contributing directly to the original p5play project (for example, by creating a temporary fork to submit a pull request or patch to the official repository).

The Licensee may not use the Content to create a competing product or service.

### 1c. Limited Redistribution

The Licensee may host verbatim, unmodified copies of the Content only. "Verbatim copies" means exact duplicates of the Content as provided by the Licensor, without changes. The Licensee may not sell or sublicense the Content.

### 1d. No Military Use

The Content shall not be used in any projects commissioned by, endorsed by, or developed for military organizations or their contractors.

### 1e. Attribution Required

The Licensee must publicly display appropriate credit to the Licensor for the Content, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the Licensee or the Licensee's use, unless the Licensor has given prior written consent.

Use of the "made with p5play" Loading Screen is required for all published work that uses p5play, unless the work is published on an online code editing platform or other web app that was approved by the Licensor to be exempt from this requirement, in which case the loading screen will not appear. Attribution can then be made at the top of the primary script file or in a README file. The following is an example of acceptable attribution:

```js
/**
 * Made with p5play!
 * https://p5play.org
 */
```

## 2. Licensee Eligibility Requirements

The License is granted on a subscription basis through one of the following payment plans:

- Per-semester payments (default)
- Annual payments
- Custom payment arrangements

Custom payment arrangements must be negotiated directly with the Licensor and the Licensor will define what use is permitted under the custom arrangement.

The Licensee must pay the appropriate amount, as determined by the Licensor, for the quantity of students that will be using the Content. If Licensees have any concerns about what amount is appropriate for their use, they must contact the Licensor.

Individuals over the age of 18 can pay licensing fees for their own educational use.

Parental guardians or other adults can make purchases on behalf of a user that's a minor, and are responsible for ensuring compliance with this Agreement.

A Licensee can pay more than the required amount if they wish to support the Licensor's work to a greater extent, which is greatly appreciated.

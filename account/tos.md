# Terms of Service

By using p5play.org, you agree to these terms of service and p5play's [End User License Agreement](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/p5play/blob/main/EULA.md).

p5play is a sole proprietorship owned and operated by Quinton Ashley.

## Account Creation

You must provide accurate and complete information when creating an account.

Students must register for an account with their school using a class code provided by their teacher. Students may not create an account without a class code.

Teacher accounts are for educators who are 18 years of age or older.

Developer accounts are for users who are 13 years of age or older.

## Learn pages

The "Learn p5play" interactive textbook, located in the "Learn" section of the website at https://p5play.org/learn, is proprietary content created by Quinton Ashley. It is free for personal use and teacher evaluation only.

Educational use in class or coursework typically requires the purchase of a [p5play Educational License](https://p5play.org/teach), which is sold at a per-student, per-semester rate, mainly to schools.

The [p5play Professional License](https://p5play.org/teach) grants licensees the right to use "Learn p5play" on an individual basis, even for educational use but just not for teaching. So a pro licensee student doesn't need to additionally purchase an Educational License.

## Denial of Service

You may be denied service, including temporary account restrictions, deletion of account, or a permanent ban, for violating or suspected violation of these terms of service.

p5play may contact you, your employer, or law enforcement if necessary to investigate or resolve a violation of these terms of service.

## Appeals

If you are denied service, you may not create another account without permission. Contact info@p5play.org to appeal a denial of service.

## Account Security

p5play.org uses AWS Cognito to securely manage accounts. You are responsible for keeping your account password a secret. p5play is not liable for any loss or damages due to unauthorized access to your account.

## Changes

These terms may be modified from time to time. Your continued use of p5play.org after the changes indicates your acceptance of the modified terms.

## We may share Student achievement with the school or school district

In order to support school and district needs to oversee p5play.org usage in their classrooms, we may allow a Student’s school or school district to access reporting data on student progress and achievement, presented on a student-level, classroom-level, teacher-level, grade-level or school-level basis for Students enrolled in a Teacher’s section. The reports available to school and district administrators will be based on the same data that is displayed on the Student progress report that is also shared with the Student's Teacher(s). If Teachers choose to give Students feedback on coursework and projects through p5play.org, we may also share this with school or district administrators upon request.

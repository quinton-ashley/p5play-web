This License Agreement ("Agreement") is made between Quinton Ashley, the sole copyright owner of p5play ("Licensor") and an individual, organization, or company ("Licensee") actively paying Pro license fees on a subscription basis.

https://p5play.org/pro

For educational use, see the [p5play Educational License](https://p5play.org/teach).

## 1. License Grant

This Agreement ("License") primarily governs the use of the p5play and p5play-pro software libraries (collectively, the "Content").

The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-perpetual worldwide license to use the Content, subject to the following restrictions.

### 1a. Educational Use Limitation

The Licensee is expressly forbidden from using the Content for educational purposes, such as in class or coursework.

Users must purchase a [p5play Educational License](https://p5play.org/teach) subscription for educational use of the Content, even if it's used indirectly through a third-party provider, unless their use is covered by a p5play Educational licensee.

As an exception, the Content can be used in interactive art that is educational in nature, but the topics covered must not be related to computer programming or game development. For example, a game that teaches players how to cook is permitted.

### 1b. Derivative Work Restrictions

Any modification, enhancement, or adaptation of the Content ("Derivative Work") shall be owned by the Licensor. Derivative Works must be created for the sole purpose of improving the Content, for the benefit of all users of p5play.

By creating a Derivative Work, the Licensee hereby:

- Assigns all rights, title, and interest in the Derivative Work to the Licensor
- Waives any moral rights in the Derivative Work
- Grants the Licensor exclusive rights to use, modify, and distribute the Derivative Work
- Agrees to execute any documents necessary to perfect such rights

The Licensee must notify and distribute Derivative Works to the Licensor via GitHub PR, email (info@p5play.org), or Discord post/message and not by any other means.

### 1c. Limited Redistribution

The Licensee may host verbatim, unmodified copies of the Content only. "Verbatim copies" means exact duplicates of the Content as provided by the Licensor, without changes. The Licensee may not sell or sublicense the Content.

### 1d. No Military Use

The Content shall not be used in any projects commissioned by, endorsed by, or developed for military organizations or their contractors.

### 1e. Portfolio Project Exception

Former Licensees maintain the right to use the Content under the terms of this license in portfolio projects that satisfy all of the following conditions:

- Active development occurred during an active Pro License term
- No substantial modifications for over 3 months
- Project only receives maintenance updates

### 1f. Attribution Required

The Licensee must publicly display appropriate credit to the Licensor for the Content, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the Licensee or the Licensee's use, unless the Licensor has given prior written consent.

Use of the "made with p5play" Loading Screen is required for all published work that uses p5play, unless the work is published on an online code editing platform or other web app that was approved by the Licensor to be exempt from this requirement, in which case the loading screen will not appear. Attribution can then be made at the top of the primary script file or in a README file. The following is an example of acceptable attribution:

```js
/**
 * Made with p5play!
 * https://p5play.org
 */
```

## 2. Licensee Eligibility Requirements

Active subscription status must be maintained through the Licensor's authorized payment platforms ([GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/quinton-ashley) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/p5play)) at the designated tier level.

Eligible Licensees must either be:

- Individuals aged 18 or older purchasing for their own use
- Legal guardians/adults purchasing on behalf of minors (accepting full responsibility for license compliance)

The Licensee shall contact info@p5play.org to verify appropriate tier selection prior to use. License renewal requires continuous monthly or annual payments at the selected tier level.

Voluntary contributions exceeding the minimum tier requirements are permitted and appreciated.

Note: Portfolio projects meeting Section 1e criteria retain limited usage rights post-subscription. All other rights require active subscription status.

## 3. Licensee Consent

## 4. "Learn p5play" Interactive Textbook Access

The Licensee is granted access to the [p5play.org Learn pages](https://p5play.org/learn) for their own learning and evaluation only.

## 5. Supplemental Materials

Supplemental Materials, such as the p5play-ios app template and p5play Game Design Fundamentals curriculum, are provided exclusively to authorized Licensees. These materials are intended to enhance the use of the Content and are not to be redistributed or used outside the scope of this Agreement.

## 6. Revenue Share

The Licensee must pay the Licensor 10% of gross revenue when the lifetime combined revenue from all projects using the Content exceeds $1000 USD (one thousand United States Dollars). This threshold calculation includes all historical revenue since first use of the Content. "Gross revenue" includes but is not limited to:

- Direct sales

The Licensee shall:

If the Licensee is not satisfied with the Content, it is their responsibility to discontinue use of the Content.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages suffered by the Licensee resulting from the use or inability to use the Content.

Licensees must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using p5play. It is illegal to create content that infringes on the rights of others. Licensees are fully liable for any content they create with p5play.

## 9. Termination

Termination of the Agreement will occur if the Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Therefore, termination can occur automatically, without notice from the Licensor.

Note that the Licensor reserves the right to change the cost of renewing this license at any time. Any lapse in licensing payments will result in the immediate termination of this Agreement.

## 10. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

This Agreement can be amended by the Licensor at any time. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

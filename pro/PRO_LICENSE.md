**_For educational use, see the [p5play Educational License](https://p5play.org/teach)._**

## 1. License Grant

This Agreement ("License") primarily governs the use of the p5play and p5play-pro software libraries (collectively, the "Content").

The Licensee can create closed source, commercial projects that depend on the Content.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-perpetual worldwide license to use the Content, subject to the following restrictions.

### 1a. Educational Use Limitations

Under fair use, the Licensee may produce educational content, such as YouTube tutorials, that explains and showcases use of the Content in a fixed media format, which does not enable direct interaction with the Content.

The Content can also be used in interactive art that is educational in nature, but the topics covered must not be related to computer programming or game development. For example, a game that teaches players how to cook is permitted.

Typical academic use of the Content, such as in class instruction or coursework, is prohibited under this License.

To use the Content for academic purposes, create an account on p5play.org, pay license fees as determined by the Licensor, and agree to the [p5play Educational License](https://p5play.org/teach). This is required even if the Content is used indirectly through a third-party provider.

### 1b. Derivative Work

Publishing modified versions of the Content ("Derivative Work") is permitted only for the purpose of contributing directly to the original p5play project (for example, by creating a temporary fork to submit a pull request or patch to the official repository).

The Licensee may not use the Content to create a competing product or service.

### 1c. Limited Redistribution

The Licensee may host verbatim, unmodified copies of the Content only. "Verbatim copies" means exact duplicates of the Content as provided by the Licensor, without changes. The Licensee may not sell or sublicense the Content.

### 1d. No Military Use

The Content shall not be used in any projects commissioned by, endorsed by, or developed for military organizations or their contractors.

### 1e. Attribution Required

The Licensee must publicly display appropriate credit to the Licensor for the Content, but not in any way that suggests the Licensor endorses the Licensee or the Licensee's use, unless the Licensor has given prior written consent.

Use of the "made with p5play" Loading Screen is required for all published work that uses p5play, unless the work is published on an online code editing platform or other web app that was approved by the Licensor to be exempt from this requirement, in which case the loading screen will not appear. Attribution can then be made at the top of the primary script file or in a README file. The following is an example of acceptable attribution:

```js
/**
 * Made with p5play!
 * https://p5play.org
 */
```

## 2. Licensee Eligibility Requirements

Eligible Licensees must either be:

- Individuals aged 18 or older
- Legal guardians/adults acting on behalf of minors

Licensees must create an account on p5play.org and agree to the [Terms of Service](https://p5play.org/account/tos.md) and [Privacy Policy](https://p5play.org/account/privacy_policy.md).

## 3. Licensee Obligations

The Licensee shall make an immediate report to the Licensor (info@p5play.org) of published commercial projects that uses the Content ("Projects"), including but not limited to:

- Games
- Game Demos
- Apps
- Websites
- Interactive art installations

The Licensor's goal is to minimize the barrier to entry for new developers and artists. Thus, paying a fee for commercial use is only required when a Licensee's Projects are commercially successful.

The Licensee shall track lifetime combined revenue ("Combined Revenue") from all projects that use the Content, maintaining accurate financial records for audit purposes. Combined Revenue includes but is not limited to:

- Direct sales
- In-app purchases
- Subscription fees
- Advertising revenue
- Crowdfunding
- Donations related to projects using the Content

The Licensee shall make an immediate report to the Licensor (info@p5play.org) if Combined Revenue exceeds $500 USD (five hundred United States Dollars).

If Combined Revenue exceeds $1000 USD (one thousand United States Dollars), the Licensee is no longer eligible to use the Content under this License. A new license deal must be negotiated with the Licensor, which will include a 5% fee on Combined Revenue to fund the continued development of p5play.

## 4. Privacy

Licensees optionally consent to p5play using Google Analytics to track how they use p5play. To revoke this consent, you can use a browser extension to block Google Analytics or set `window._p5play_gtagged = false;` before loading p5play.

## 5. No Warranty

The Content is provided "as is." The Licensor makes no warranties, express or implied, including without limitation any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, concerning the Content.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages suffered by the Licensee resulting from the use or inability to use the Content.

Licensees must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using p5play. It is illegal to create content that infringes on the rights of others. Licensees are fully liable for any content they create with p5play.

## 7. Amendments

This Agreement can be amended by the Licensor at any time. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

## 8. Termination

Termination of the Agreement will occur if the Licensee fails to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement. Therefore, termination can occur automatically, without notice from the Licensor.

Upon termination, the Licensee must cease all use and distribution of the Content.

## 9. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

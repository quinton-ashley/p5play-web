				<p><a href="https://perhapseb.github.io/ChromaJump/" target="_blank">"ChromaJump"</a>, by Sebastian C.
					(age 18), is a retro puzzle platformer. Swap between tinted camera lenses to reveal and remove parts
					of the world!</p>
				<p>Is a wall blocking your path? A gap you can't possibly cross? Try seeing the world in a different
					light.</p>
				<p>Use your keyboard or plug in a controller to play. Sit back and enjoy the meditative music and
					satisfying sound design of this atmospheric game. The depth of a vast cavern is simulated through a
					subtle parallax effect.</p>
				<p>Play as an adorably pudgy glowing alien that moon jumps through life and is unfazed by deathâ€¦ pick up
					right where you last touched solid ground and try again! Levels get progressively more challenging.
					In the end you'll need to be light on your toes and take a few leaps of faith.</p>
				<p>This game won because of its highly polished execution of a simple yet clever mechanic. It makes
					great use of <a href="https://q5js.org" target="_blank">q5.js</a>' Auto-HDR feature. Note the vivid
					contrast between the bright platforms and dark backgrounds.</p>

				<p><a href="https://doityourseph2.github.io/rat-race/" target="_blank">"Rat Race"</a>, by Joseph Chee,
					prompts players to assist collared shirt and tie clad rats keen on climbing the corporate ladder. It
					was originally presented as an <a href="https://doityourseph.com/#/projects/rat-race"
						target="_blank">interactive art installation</a> at Nanyang Technological University.</p>
				<p>Players watch as the rats inevitably get kicked around by sloth managers, pushed by worker bees,
					yapped to by sneaky weasels, bombarded with the prideful peacock's trophies, and growled at by
					wolves in sheep's clothes. Even the lions at the top are struggling in the perpetual pursuit of
					money, power, and status. No one wins in a rat race!</p>
				<p>This game won the jam because of its brilliant visuals, thought provoking theme, and charming
					character design. The code features excellent use of animation sequencing.</p>

				<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3171380/Shenaniguns/" target="_blank">"Shenaniguns"</a>,
					by Lachlan Noble (age 15), is an online multiplayer top-down shooter. Each life you get some random
					things to fight with... or die trying! You could get a normal gun, but are just as likely to get
					bowling balls, ninja stars, or even a DJ deck?!</p>
				<p>There's also a wide variety of maps and game modes to try out. Go head to head in a free for all,
					capture the flag, or team up with friends for a boss fight with Vectah.</p>
				<p>This game won because of its zany, fast paced, and chaotic gameplay. The game's code makes great use
					of raycasting for hit detection and has impressive bot AI. Yet most notably, it's the first game to
					ever use p5play server side for online multiplayer!</p>
